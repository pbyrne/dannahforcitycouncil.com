Dannah for City Council
=======================

This is the source for [Dannah for City Council](https://dannahforcitycouncil.com).

Setup
-----

This uses [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) to build static HTML, so you'll need Node and Yarn to get started. Then `yarn install` should get you going. It optionally uses Make to perform the various common commands.

Usage
-----

It has a Makefile with wrappers around Eleventy commands:

* `make` to build the site
* `make serve` to run a local live server
* `make clean` to delete the built files
