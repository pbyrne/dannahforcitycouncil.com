My Urban Policy will have four areas of focus: Affordable Housing, Small Business, Urban Development, and Sustainability. By designing policy focused on these areas of growth, residents can ensure the City maintains the balance between suburban and urban living and doing so in an ecologically balanced manner rooted in social justice and equity.

### Affordable Housing

In the greater Metro Area at risk populations for homelessness include Black, Indigeneous, LGBTQIA, and formerly incarcerated. In Roseville, roughly 40% of renters are considered cost burdened - those whom [pay more than 30% of their income on housing](https://www.cityofroseville.com/DocumentCenter/View/27111/Roseville-Housing-Study-2018-Update) and concerned community members estimate around 175 homeless children are in Roseville.

I will support Affordable Housing efforts in Roseville through Urban Policy and rezoning to ensure multi-generational families and seniors have options to live in Roseville and age in place.

As a Council Member I will continue to be an advocate for those at risk for losing their housing or currently facing homelessness.

> If elected I will fight to eliminate homelessness and cost burdened households in Roseville by 2030.

With the following policy goals I will work to ensure housing in Roseville, whether renting or buying, is first and foremost attainable, accessible, and works for them:

#### Expand Protections for Renters

* ‘Ban the Box’ regarding Criminal Background checks on Rental Applications
*  Eliminating Rental Application Fees
* Creation of a Just Cause Ordinance for Evictions
* Create an appeals process for tenant grievances when harrassment and/or discrimination is involved.
* Ban Section 8 discrimination and work with rental agencies to provide Section 8 housing in both school districts.

#### Urban Policy to promote Affordability

* Support development and zoning for small diversified rental units which are a safeguard against expensive rents and potential increases in property taxes.
* Supporting Multiple-Use renovations, as needed, of public spaces and new development which will have a combination of small businesses and housing. The Multiple-Use urban design demonstrates that areas comprised of residences and businesses leads to safer neighborhoods.

#### Create a Network of Support

* Build a coalition of residents and leaders in our City and County to reorganize resources and ensure their accessibility to families and individuals
* Work with community and faith leaders to maintain and expand services to help those currently facing homelessness
* Ensure resources are on the City Website and easily navigable
* Support housing development that provides various housing options for the many families and individuals in Roseville.
*  Develop a Community Advisory Board for collaboration and accountability

### Small Business

Urban development can positively contribute towards a city’s growth when given direction. As a Council Member I will have a clear vision of Roseville’s future and I will fight to ensure our city is built for long term residents and families. By offering locally owned, accessible goods and services our community thrives twofold: as the resident and the local business owner. I will fight to promote equal access  to owning a business for marginalized communities.

I will adopt an urban policy which supports the small business owner by:

* Ensuring mixed-use housing and business development as aforementioned.
* Increase the City’s partnerships with small businesses owned by women of color, BIPOC (Black, Indigeneous and Persons of Color), and women.
* Develop city relationships with the Black Chamber of Commerce, the Metropolitan Economic Development Association to promote small business ownership in Roseville and provide a means for residents to achieve their small business goals.
* Further develop city relationships with the School Boards of the ISD 623 and 621 to nourish students interested in entrepreneurship.
* Develop city relationships with Banks, Microbanks, and Credit Unions to further enable diversified small business ownership.
* Ensure Zoning is supportive of the small business owner and accessible for all Roseville Residents (sidewalks, buslines). Support mixed-use zoning and walking districts in Twin Lakes Parkway, Rice & Larpenteur, Har-Mar Mall and Rosedale Mall
